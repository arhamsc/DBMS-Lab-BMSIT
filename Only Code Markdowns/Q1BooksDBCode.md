>
> 2. Get the particulars of borrowers who have borrowed more than 3 books, but from Jan 2017 to Jun 2017.
>
> 3. Delete a book in BOOK table. Update the contents of other tables to reflect this data manipulation operation.
>
> 4. Partition the BOOK table based on year of publication. Demonstrate its working with a simple query.
>
> 5. Create a view of all books and its number of copies that are currently available in the Library.

### Queries(Answers)

Q1:

> ```sql
> SELECT B.book_id, B.title, B.publisher_name, BA.author_name, LP.programme_name, BC.no_of_copies
>    FROM book B, book_author BA, library_programme LP, book_copies BC
>    WHERE
>        B.book_id = BA.book_id
>            AND
>        B.book_id = BC.book_id
>            AND
>        BC.programme_id = LP.programme_id;
> ```

Q2:

> ```sql
> SELECT card_no, COUNT(card_no)
>    FROM book_lending
>    WHERE date_out BETWEEN '01-Jan-2017' AND '01-Jun-2017'
>    HAVING COUNT(card_no) >= 3
>    GROUP BY card_no;
> ```

Q3:

In the Scheme we have linked the book_id with "ON DELETE CASCADE" as foreign key to other tables which makes sure that when the book is deleted from the "BOOK" table, it deletes the whole row linked to this book from the other tables also.

> ```sql
> DELETE
>   FROM book
>   WHERE book_id = 1;
> ```

> > _Note: "PARTITION BY" when used inside a table(query) creates a sub view to use, as the Aggregate functions can't be used with extra fields, by creating PARTITION we can use other fields(columns) also. It is always used with "OVER()"_

Q5:

As mentioned in above question, we partition(create sub table) w.r.t title, hence we were able to use book_id, title and other columns, and distinct is used to not repeat the book values.

> ```sql
> CREATE VIEW remaining_books AS
>    SELECT book_id, SUM(total_books) as total_copies, SUM(lend_books) as borrowed_books, (SUM(total_books)-SUM(lend_books)) as remaining
>        FROM (
>            SELECT book_id, no_of_copies as total_books, 0 as lend_books from book_copies
>                UNION ALL
>            SELECT DISTINCT book_id, null as total_books, COUNT(card_no) as lend_books from book_lending group by(book_id)
>        )
>        GROUP BY book_id
>        ORDER BY book_id;
> SELECT * FROM remaining_books;
> DROP VIEW remaining_books;
> ```
>
> _Note: When we change the actual table tuples(rows) the VIEW also changes i.e it reflects the latest data from the tables._
